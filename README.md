# CS 46X OSUno Repository

## Project Structure

Inside of your repository, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
.
├── docs/
├── src/
├── wip/
├── .gitignore
├── LICENSE
└── README.md
```

The `docs/` directory hold a standalone Starlight + Astro website. Check below for more.

The `src/` directory will contain your codebase.

The `wip/` directory is your Work in Progress directory. It contains assignment templates that you will modify/update during the year. You can add more files there that support your project (e.g., diagrams, design files, documents, reviews, progress reports, etc.)

The `LICENSE` is currently CC0 and will need to be changed by the end of the year.
